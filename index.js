/*
Welcome to the js variables exercise! On the lines below, you'll get practice creating 
variables using the "const" and "let" keywords in JavaScript. You should pick appropriate
data types for your answer. 

Look through this file for requirements that start with //REQUIREMENT N:
You will add your code on the line or lines that start with //TODO:

EXAMPLE:
//REQUIREMENT 1: How many days have you been a developer?
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, timeAsDev, with your answer. Make sure to use a keyword that allows the value to be updated later!

If you started 4 days ago, you would change the previous line so that it says: 
let timeAsDev = 4;

IMPORTANT
You should have the index.html file open in your browser as you work through this
exercise. If you aren't sure what this means, you should watch the How to Edit Code 
video: https://youtu.be/vkWDQzl_x3s before continuing.

If you currently doubt your ability to create variables, I hope this exercise casts that doubt away.

//REQUIREMENT 1: How many days have you been a developer?
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, timeAsDev, with your answer. Make sure to use a keyword that allows the value to be updated later!
let timeAsDev = 5000;

//REQUIREMENT 2: What is the genus of the Largemouth Bass?
//TODO: Insantiate a variable, bassGenus, with your answer. (Google it!)
const bassGenus = 'Micropterus';

//REQUIREMENT 3: True or false, you should use the "var" keyword instead of "const" or "let" to create variables.
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, isVarPreferred, with your answer.
const isVarPreferred = false;

//REQUIREMENT 4: Roughly how many gallons of water are on Earth?
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, gallonsWaterOnEarth, with your answer. (Google it!)
const gallonsWaterOnEarth = 326000000000000000000n;

//REQUIREMENT 5: Instantiate a variable, variablesThusFar, with the total number of variables you made before this question.
//TODO: Make sure to use a keyword that allows the value to be updated later!
let variablesThusFar = 4;

//REQUIREMENT 6: How many feet are in a fathom?
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, feetInFathom, with your answer
const feetInFathom = 6;

//REQUIREMENT 7: What is the plural of fish if we're talking about different species?
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, fishPluralForm, with your answer.
const fishPluralForm = 'fishes';

//REQUIREMENT 8: Update timeAsDev to represent how many days you've been a developer at the end of next week.
//TODO: Reassign timeAsDev with your answer.
timeAsDev = 5007;

//REQUIREMENT 9: True or false, instantiating a variable with the let keyword allows you to reassign the value later.
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, canChangeLet, with your answer.
const canChangeLet = true;

//REQUIREMENT 10: What is the default value of a variable in JavaScript?
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, jsDefaultValue, with your answer.
let jsDefaultValue;

//REQUIREMENT 11: What's the difference between null and undefined?
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, nullVsUndefined, with your answer.
const nullVsUndefined = 'undefined is the placeholder value that JavaScript assigns. Null is the value that a developer would assign to represent the intentional lack of a value';

//REQUIREMENT 12: If someone is signing up for a user account, and leaves a field blank, what value should you assign to it?
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, userOmitted, with your answer.
const userOmitted = null;

//REQUIREMENT 13: Update variablesThusFar with the new number of variables you've made so far.
//TODO: Reassign variablesThusFar with your answer. 
variablesThusFar = 11;

//REQUIREMENT 14: True or false, the stonefish gets its name because people use them as stepping stones.
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, stonefishAreSteps, with your answer.
const stonefishAreSteps = false;
