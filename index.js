/*
Welcome to the js exercise template! This paragraph should be changed for
each exercise. It is intended to give some high level instruction about the 
exercise goal. The rest of this multi-line comment should be included in every
exercise.

Look through this file for requirements that start with //REQUIREMENT N:
You will add your code on the line or lines that start with //TODO:

EXAMPLE:
//REQUIREMENT 1: Do Ichthyologists study fish, birds, or mammals?
//TODO: On the following line, change null to your answer. Make sure that it's a string!
let ichthyologistFocus = null;

You would change the previous line so that it says: 
let ichthyologistFocus = 'fish';

You will occasionally see longer comments (like this one) that will include extra
instruction, helpful hints, best practices, or other content. 

IMPORTANT
You should have the index.html file open in your browser as you work through this
exercise. If you aren't sure what this means, you should watch the <INSERT LINK HERE> 
video before continuing.

I hope that you get hooked on coding!

You've reached the end of this exercise! If you need more practice with data types, you're in luck.
You'll use these concepts in every subsequent program you write.
