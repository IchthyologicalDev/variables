/*
Welcome to the js variables exercise! On the lines below, you'll get practice creating 
variables using the "const" and "let" keywords in JavaScript. You should pick appropriate
data types for your answer. 

Look through this file for requirements that start with //REQUIREMENT N:
You will add your code on the line or lines that start with //TODO:

EXAMPLE:
//REQUIREMENT 1: How many days have you been a developer?
//TODO: Instantiate a variable, timeAsDev, with your answer. Make sure to use a keyword that allows the value to be updated later!

If you started 4 days ago, you would change the previous line so that it says: 
let timeAsDev = 4;

IMPORTANT
You should have the index.html file open in your browser as you work through this
exercise. If you aren't sure what this means, you should watch the <INSERT LINK HERE> 
video before continuing.

If you currently doubt your ability to create variables, I hope this exercise casts that doubt away.
